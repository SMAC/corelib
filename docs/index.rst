Welcome to SMAC's documentation!
================================

The purpose of this collection of documents is to document the infra-module 
communication architecture introduced with the second version of SMAC and to
provide enough information to implement a module specification in a chosen
platform with the highest integration degree possible.

The main points touched by this documentation are:

* A general overview of the terminology, concepts, technologies and solutions
  behind the project;
* The module communication subsystem;
* The module API specification platform;
* The single module implementations provided by SMAC;
* An overview of the process needed to implement a chosen module specification
  in a chosen programming language.

For a general introduction to the SMAC project please refer to the `SMAC home
page <http://smac.hefr.ch>`_.
