SMAC - Smart Multimedia Archive for Conferences
===============================================

SMAC is a distributed system to record, analyse, index, store and publish
conferences and single talks with a whole collection of related metadata.

The captured and uploaded data (such as documents, slideshows, audio/video
files, transcriptions,...), will be aligned (i.e temporal synchronization),
indexed and published on a variety of different supports such as web
applications or external systems.

For more information about the SMAC architecture, please visit the projects's
